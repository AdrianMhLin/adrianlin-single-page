      <h2>Site map</h2>
      <p>
        After understanding what was needed in a personal site, I created a site map with pages, sections, and content. This site map is like a road map to the various sections I would need to code up and produce content for, and allowed me to see the project from a top-down view.

      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      <p>
        After defining the content and their architectural relation to one another, I sketched out a variety of pages with Sharpie on paper. Eventually I created more medium fidelity wireframes on Sketch 3 so that I had a better visual idea of my eventual website. In doing this, I saw the parallels between design and HTML/CSS: setting out the contents in IA was the HTML: content, while wireframing created the CSS: the style.

      <h2>Modular code</h2>
      <p>
        I coded up my website with a Ruby-on-Rails framework with some Bootstrap to get me started. I created templates for my project sample so that the styles could be consistent and I would know how to create new project pages as I built my portfolio. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I made my code modular by splitting up different sections and partials which would be rendered with the Ruby-on-Rail engine. This allowed me to see the whole website from the big picture view, instead of seeing a jumble of markup.
